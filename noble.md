description: 'High-security, auditable set of contained cryptographic libraries and tools'
---

**noble cryptography** is a high-security, easily auditable set of contained cryptographic libraries with following features:

- Zero or minimal dependencies
- Highly readable TypeScript / JS code
- PGP-signed releases and transparent NPM builds

The idea was to: 1) improve knowledge of cryptography 2) improve supply chain security of JS ecosystem 3) provide libraries that could be used for learning, because other libs are too low-level / unfriendly to beginners.

Active projects:

- **ciphers** ([github](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ciphers), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/ciphers)): cryptographic ciphers, including Salsa20, ChaCha, AES and FF1.
- **curves** ([github](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/curves)): elliptic curve cryptography, including Weierstrass, Edwards, Montgomery curves, pairings, hash-to-curve, poseidon hash, schnorr, secp256k1, ed25519, ed448, p521, bn254, bls12-381 and others.
  - 4kb versions of _curves_ with even better auditability and rarer update schedule: secp256k1 ([github](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/secp256k1)) and ed25519 ([github](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/ed25519))
- **hashes** ([github](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/hashes)): hash functions, MACs & KDFs, including SHA, RIPEMD, BLAKE, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF & Scrypt
- **post-quantum** ([github](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-post-quantum), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/post-quantum)): post-quantum public key algorithms: ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA aka Kyber, Dilithium and SPHINCS+

The code is also available on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/paulmillr/backup) and [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/paulmillr)

### Audits

At this point (aug 2024), various parts of noble had 5 audits. I'm looking for:

1. Auditors, with good knowledge of cryptography and/or JS
    - Paid: whenever there is enough funding
    - Unpaid: whoever is willing to donate their time for the public good
2. Funding, of paid auditors

Contact me if you want to help with the effort.

### Demo

You can try out noble in the browser JS console of the webpage. There are 3 global variables: `nobleCiphers`, `nobleCurves`, `nobleHashes`. The webpage also has two demo apps:

- App I: Elliptic curve calculator, calculate public keys and signatures
- App II: Add, subtract, multiply points on the chosen elliptic curve
