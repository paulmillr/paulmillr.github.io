Here’s a list of books and articles about libertarianism which I recommend.

## Books

1. [Walter Block — Defending the undefendable](http://mises.org/document/3490/Defending-the-Undefendable) — a tale on negative social / economic issues with governments prohibitions. Block defends pimps, drug dealers, blackmailers, corrupt policemen, and loan sharks as "economic heroes".
2. [Heinlein — The Moon is a Harsh Mistress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress) — tale of revolution, of the rebellion of a former penal colony on the Moon against its masters on the Earth.
3. [Murray Rothbard — What Has Government Done to Our Money?](http://mises.org/document/617/What-Has-Government-Done-to-Our-Money) — the not-so-brief history of economics in XIX-XX centuries. How central banks were created, how people lost power over their own earnings.
4. David Bergland — Libertarianism in one lesson — the basics about libertarian philosophy.

Other must-read books on economics:

* [Frédéric Bastiat - That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen](https://mises.org/library/which-seen-and-which-not-seen)
* [Ludwig von Mises - The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality](https://mises.org/library/anti-capitalistic-mentality)
* [Friedrich von Hayek - The Road to Serfdom](https://mises.org/library/road-serfdom-0), The Fatal Conceit
* [Murray Rothbard — The Case Against the Fed](http://mises.org/document/3430/The-Case-Against-the-Fed). Tells history of american federal reserve system, reasons of its shittiness and a bit more.

Other nice readings:

* David Friedman — The Machinery of Freedom — utilitarian consequentialist view on anarcho-capitalism.
* [Hans-Hermann Hoppe — Myth of National Defense](http://mises.org/document/1092/Myth-of-National-Defense-The-Essays-on-the-Theory-and-History-of-Security-Production) — why states are inefficient in providing security. Describes private free-market defense and law production & how state-less societies may defend themselves from states.
* Frank Karsten — Beyond Democracy — why democracy does not lead to solidarity, prosperity and liberty but to unrest, runaway spending and a tyrannical government.
* [Murray Rothbard — The Ethics of Liberty](http://mises.org/document/1179/The-Ethics-of-Liberty). Describes ethics of libertarian philosophy, natural rights (freedoms). Contains a bit about rights of mother on her child and responses to consequentialist critics of non-aggression principle. Pretty similar to “Defending the undefendable”, although less interesting.
* [Walter Block — The Privatization of Roads and Highways](http://mises.org/document/4084/The-Privatization-of-Roads-and-Highways). Big book about benefits & detailed description of how roads will function if they will be freed from government monopolies.
* [Meganezia](http://lib.rus.ec/b/122647). Book series about a fictional future libertarian state Meganesia. The action takes place in the 2040-2050. All the books, except the first one are very large, ~1.5-2.5K pages each. Contains a lot of interesting science fiction esp. about space exploration and genetic engineering.

## P.S.

Anarchy, n. 4. a theory which regards the union of order with the absence of all direct or coercive government as the political ideal. 5. confusion in general; disorder.

Government produces all order. <br />
Under anarchy there is no government. <br />
Therefore anarchy is chaos.

---------------

In Washington there isn’t any plan <br />
With “feeding David” on page sixty-four; <br />
It must be accidental that the milk man <br />
Leaves a bottle at my door. <br />
It must be accidental that the butcher <br />
Has carcasses arriving at his shop <br />
The very place where, when I need some meat, <br />
I accidentally stop. <br />
My life is chaos turned miraculous; <br />
I speak a word and people understand <br />
Although it must be gibberish since words <br />
Are not produced by governmental plan. <br />
Now law and order, on the other hand <br />
The state provides us for the public good; <br />
That’s why there’s instant justice on demand <br />
And safety in every neighborhood. <br />
