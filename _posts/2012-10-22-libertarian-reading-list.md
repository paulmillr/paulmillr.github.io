Here’s a list of books and articles about libertarianism which I recommend.

## Books

1. [Walter Block — Defending the undefendable](https://mises.org/library/book/defending-undefendable) — a tale on negative social / economic issues with governments prohibitions. Block defends pimps, drug dealers, blackmailers, corrupt policemen, and loan sharks as "economic heroes".
2. [Heinlein — The Moon is a Harsh Mistress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress) — tale of revolution, of the rebellion of a former penal colony on the Moon against its masters on the Earth.
3. [Murray Rothbard — What Has Government Done to Our Money?](https://mises.org/library/book/what-has-government-done-our-money) — the not-so-brief history of economics in XIX-XX centuries. How central banks were created, how people lost power over their own earnings.
4. David Bergland — Libertarianism in one lesson — the basics about libertarian philosophy.

Other must-read books on economics:

* [Frédéric Bastiat - That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen](https://mises.org/articles-interest/which-seen-and-which-not-seen)
* [Ludwig von Mises - The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality](https://mises.org/library/book/anti-capitalistic-mentality)
* [Friedrich von Hayek - The Road to Serfdom](https://mises.org/library/book/road-serfdom), The Fatal Conceit
* [Murray Rothbard — The Case Against the Fed](https://mises.org/library/book/case-against-fed). Tells history of american federal reserve system, reasons of its problems and a bit more.

Other nice readings:

* David Friedman — The Machinery of Freedom — utilitarian consequentialist view on anarcho-capitalism.
* [Hans-Hermann Hoppe — Myth of National Defense](https://mises.org/library/book/myth-national-defense-essays-theory-and-history-security-production) — why states are inefficient in providing security. Describes private free-market defense and law production & how state-less societies may defend themselves from states.
* Frank Karsten — Beyond Democracy — why democracy does not lead to solidarity, prosperity and liberty but to unrest, runaway spending and a tyrannical government.
* [Murray Rothbard — The Ethics of Liberty](https://mises.org/library/book/ethics-liberty). Describes ethics of libertarian philosophy, natural rights (freedoms). Contains a bit about rights of mother on her child and responses to consequentialist critics of non-aggression principle. Pretty similar to “Defending the undefendable”, although less interesting.

## Articles

* [The Myth of Natural Monopoly](https://mises.org/mises-daily/myth-natural-monopoly) — facts on unnaturalness and ineffectiveness of [“natural monopolies”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly).
* [This is why I don’t give you a job](https://andorjakab.blog.hu/2012/01/06/this_is_why_i_don_t_give_you_a_job) — a hungarian entrepreneur’s cry from the heart on the lack of freedom.
* [Authority as a commodity and its markets](https://oetar.livejournal.com/3646.html) — (needs translation) small dive into the admitistrative markets theory with description of USSR’s authority market.

## P.S.

Anarchy, n. 4. a theory which regards the union of order with the absence of all direct or coercive government as the political ideal. 5. confusion in general; disorder.

Government produces all order. <br />
Under anarchy there is no government. <br />
Therefore anarchy is chaos.

---------------

In Washington there isn’t any plan <br />
With “feeding David” on page sixty-four; <br />
It must be accidental that the milk man <br />
Leaves a bottle at my door. <br />
It must be accidental that the butcher <br />
Has carcasses arriving at his shop <br />
The very place where, when I need some meat, <br />
I accidentally stop. <br />
My life is chaos turned miraculous; <br />
I speak a word and people understand <br />
Although it must be gibberish since words <br />
Are not produced by governmental plan. <br />
Now law and order, on the other hand <br />
The state provides us for the public good; <br />
That’s why there’s instant justice on demand <br />
And safety in every neighborhood. <br />
